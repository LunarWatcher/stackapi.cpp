# NullStruct (`stackapi/data/structs/NullStruct.hpp`)

NullStruct is a special struct on account of being the least interesting struct. 

This struct can be used with methods the API docs say in practice never return anything, or where the result is completely irrelevant, but you still want to get a hold of the wrapper object.
